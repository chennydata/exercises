    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

In question 3, I did the z test on appliants with black-sounding names and found that the p-value is quite low. In fact, it does not even pass that 5% threshold; therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. To make our analysis sound, what we can do is to take education and work experiences into consideration, as we know that the majority employers in the US equal employers and almost all companies use tracking system to sort out applicants and the key factors are of course education and experience."
